        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Mastava is a traditional Uzbek soup made from rice, vegetables, and meat. It's a hearty and
            flavorful dish often enjoyed as a comforting meal during colder months. The rich flavors of the
            broth combined with tender meat and fresh vegetables make it a favorite in Central Asian
            cuisine.</p>
